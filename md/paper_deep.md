# Exploring Deep Learning: How Neural Networks Can Be Used to Recognize Handwritten Digits

## Abstract

Deep learning offers us an alternative way to approach problem-solving that differs from traditional algorithmic methods. Instead of telling the algorithm what to do, one can just show it lots of examples. This can significantly reduce development time, as it eliminates the need for complex logical rules and patterns. Furthermore, it makes it easier to scale and customize the product because just modifying the training data enables a neural network to learn and adapt new behaviors efficiently.

Deep neural networks are biologically inspired computational systems composed of multiple layers that process some input data based on internal parameters. Those parameters are learned and adjusted over time using the *backpropagation* algorithm.

Furthermore, the use of statistical instead of logical methods to analyze and solve problems makes it possible to quickly solve tasks that would have required significant programming effort using conventional approaches like speech, object, or handwriting recognition, which is what I will focus on in this paper.

Our approach involves revisiting the theoretical background of deep learning and its major components in [part 1](#theory), followed by the application of these concepts to model and train a deep neural network capable of recognizing handwritten digits from scratch in [part 2](#praxis).
